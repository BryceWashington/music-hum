                    Albums, at their best, are one of the most powerful forms of artistic expression. Unlike individual
                    songs, they give artists the space to tell deeper, more emotionally layered stories. But in the
                    streaming era, which incentivises streamability, many albums feel like afterthoughts. They often
                    resemble collections of re-streamable songs designed for charts, rather than cohesive pieces of art.
                    Today, the album as a narrative art form is fading.

                    Released in 2019, <em>IGOR</em> is a rare exception. It's a modern album that embraces its format as
                    a vehicle for storytelling. It doesn't just feature strong music and lyrics. It fully commits to a
                    character, an emotional arc, and a consistent sonic world.

                    The album follows Igor, a romantic alter-ego of Tyler, through the unraveling of a one-sided love
                    affair. At the start, Igor is caught up in the thrill of new love. But the relationship is
                    complicated. The man he falls for is emotionally unavailable, closeted, and already involved with a
                    woman. As the story progresses, Igor's excitement turns to anxiety, then desperation, and finally
                    obsession. He begs for affection, lashes out in jealousy, and fantasizes about eliminating the
                    obstacles preventing their love.

                <p>
                    But <em>IGOR</em> isn't just about heartbreak. It's about the cycle of it. Igor eventually reaches a
                    moment of clarity, expressing gratitude for the love he felt even if it was never reciprocated.
                    However, when he tries to convince himself he's moved on, he fails and pleads to remain friends,
                    unable to fully let go, restarting the cycle all over again.

                    This website breaks down that story, song by song. It analyzes how the album's music, lyrics, and
                    emotional shifts work together to paint a nuanced portrait of unrequited love and emotional
                    self-destruction. <em>IGOR</em> is not just a collection of tracks. It's a full narrative arc, a
                    character study, and a masterclass in album-making.
